# WhatsApp Unknown Contact List

A simple script that uses [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) in order to download the list of unknown contact numbers in your WhatsApp chats. 

## Usage

```
yarn
yarn start
```

Once the script is started a QR code will appear. You need to scan the QR code with your WhatsApp scanner (like WhatsApp Web), then the list of unknown contacts will be available in the `out` folder as a `.csv` file.
